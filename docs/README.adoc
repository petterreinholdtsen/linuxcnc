= README for Document Writers

== Adding files

The src/Submakefile, src/docs.xml and src/index.tmpl files must be
updated to add a new document file.

The relevant pdf.adoc must be updated to include the new document in the
pdf documentation. e.g. if a new document belongs in the Master
Documentation then an entry is required in src/Master_Documentation.adoc

docs.xml is used to create the "previous" and "next" buttons at the top
of each individual HTML document. It should generally match the order of
the index.tmpl

== Notes on LinuxCNC documentation

The main LinuxCNC makefile can optionally build the documentation and
other files in this directory tree. Use "--enable-build-documentation"
when invoking src/configure, and run "make" from src.

== Notes about drawings

Many of the documents include drawings. Most of them originally
created using the non-free Windows app EasyCAD and then exported to .eps
files and included in the the docs. The original 'source' files
(EasyCad .FC7 format) were not usable on a free system.  To fix this
problem, all of the source files have been converted to .dxf files,
and added to Git. The .dxf files can be edited with multiple CAD packages,
and serve as the 'source' files for future changes to the drawings.
They can be converted from .dxf to postscript (not .eps) using QCAD,
which is available for many systems
(https://repology.org/project/qcad/versions)[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/qcad.svg)].

Unfortunately, EasyCAD (and AutoCAD) support a number of entities
that QCAD does not import properly. Including some that were used
in the LinuxCNC drawings: filled circles, filled arrowheads, non-zero
width lines, and dashed lines.  Qcad renders filled circles as
hollow, it renders all lines the same width, and it renders dashed
lines as solid, unless you tell it to do otherwise.  All of these
things make the drawings less attractive, but are somewhat
acceptable.  However, Qcad doesn't import filled arrowheads at all,
which seriously hurts the drawings.  So EasyCad was used to convert
the arrowheads to hollow before exporting them.  Hollow arrowheads
don't look as nice as solid ones, but at least they are visible.

Once exported, the arrowheads lose their relationship with the line they
are on, and need to be moved and/or rotated manually if the line is
moved.  I believe that even if they were imported back into EasyCad, the
line/arrow connection would remain broken. New lines with arrowheads can
be created in Qcad with the 'leader' dimension tool.

Because the original EPS files with filled lines and circles, wide lines,
and dashed lines look so much nicer, they will remain in Git and should
probably be used for the documents, however if they become inaccurate
because of changes in the software, we will have to edit the DXF files,
generate PostScript, and use the less pretty, but factually correct
images.

Since QCAD itself is a GUI application, the DXF to PostScript conversion
involves going clicky clicky, and can't be automated and made part of the
makefile. Also, not everyone will have QCAD installed on their system.
Therefore, both the DXF files and the resulting postscript
files are stored in Git, and the normal documentation build process only
uses the PostScript files. If/when the DXF files are edited, they have
to be converted to PostScript manually as follows:

- Start QCAD
- File → Open → choose DXF file (the drawing appears in window)
- Edit → Current Drawing Preferences → Paper +
  Set:
  * Paper size to "Letter",
  * Orientation to "Landscape" or Portrait", depending on the aspect
    ratio of the drawing.
- File → Print Preview +
  Click the "Fit to page" button on the toolbar (last button on the
  right - at least on version 2.0.4.0 of QCAD)
- File → Print
  * Select "Print to file"
  * Set the path to point to the same directory as the source .dxf file
  * Set the name to be the same as the source file, but .ps instead
    of .dxf
  * Click "OK"

The makers of QCAD also have a GPL'ed format converter called vec2web,
which can do dxf to postscript conversion from the command-line. It
is not available as a pre-compiled package, but available in source
form from https://github.com/Seablade/vec2web

vec2web depends on Qt 3 development packages to compile, so it should
not be a dependency for building the LinuxCNC docs. But if configure can
detect it, it would be nice to automate conversion from DXF to PS for
systems where vec2web is installed.

To build vec2web, apt-get install qt3-dev-tools.
The vec2web tarball contains a build script, but before you run it you
must set $QTDIR to point at your Qt 3 installation — in my case it was:

```
export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3
```

Then run the build script:

```
./build_vec2web.sh
```

There is no install step, the executable gets dumped into the build
directory. +
There is also no man page, but running it with no args prints the
following usage instructions:

```
Usage: vec2web <input file> <output file> [options]
Where options are:
        -x #      maximum x size for the output bitmap in pixel
        -y #      maximum y size for the output bitmap in pixel
        -b        black/white instead of using colors
        -o [l|p]  orientation for PS output (landscape or portrait)
        -s ..     page size for PS output (A4, A5)

e.g. vec2web drawing.dxf drawing.png
        converts drawing.dxf to a portable network graphic
```

Initial attempts to use vec2web resulted in the graphical parts of the
drawing being converted, but all text was lost. I don't know if vec2web
is worth spending much more time on, however, it _is_ GPLv2, and it
includes a library for reading DXF files, which might be worthwhile to
the Linux CNC community.

=== Drawings from QCAD

- Save as .dxf to the same directory as the image
- Set line thickness to 0.50mm
- Export the  image as 480 x 480 Resolution Auto .png

== Dealing with translations

Translation of our documentation is in transition at the moment.

We have some old-style translations that are separate asciidoc .adoc
files checked into git. These started out as copies of the english
master docs at some point, and diverged from there over time.  This
turned out not to be an ideal situation.

We are experimenting with a new system using
https://po4a.alioth.debian.org/[po4a]. With po4a, the English text
is the master document, and each paragraph is translated using
gettext, just like the strings in our software.

Some documentation of po4a is available in the
https://po4a.alioth.debian.org/man/man7/po4a.7.php[po4a(7)] manpage.

We are using po4a version 0.62, available in Debian Bullseye.

=== Transfer a translated file to po4a

If there is a pre-existing translation of the file to your language,
create a .po translation database seeded by the old translation.

If the english file is called "file.adoc" then the old pre-existing
translated file is probably called "file_fr.adoc" (for the french
translation, as an example), and the translation database should be
called "file.fr.po". Creating PO file from adoc can be done by running
this command:

```
(f=getting-linuxcnc; l=cn; po4a-gettextize \
  > --format asciidoc \
  > -m ${f}.adoc -M utf8 \
  > -l ${f}_${l}.adoc -L utf8 \
  > -p ${f}.${l}.po)
```

Similarly, for translated manual pages:

```
(f=elbpcom.1; l=es; po4a-gettextize \
  > --format asciidoc \
  > -m man/man1/${f} -M utf8 \
  > -l man/${l}/man1/${f} -L utf8 \
  -p ${f}.${l}.po)
```

To append the extracted translations to the combined PO file, do
something like this:

```
msgcat --use-first po/Documentation.es.po \
  > elbpcom.1.es.po \
  > po/Documentation.es.po
```

=== To create a new po4a translation of an untranslated file

If there is no pre-existing translation of the file to your language,
create an empty .po file to start with.  If the english file is called
"file.adoc" then the translation database should be called "file.se.po"
(for the swedish translation, as an example).  It is created by running
this command:

```
po4a-gettextize --format text \
  > -m file.adoc -M utf8 \
  > -p file.se.po
```

=== Improving the translation of a po4a-managed file

Translations are done paragraph by paragraph.

You can use a GUI tool like Poedit or Gtranslator or others, or you can
(carefully!) edit the .po file by hand.

The next time the translated document gets rebuilt, the updated
translations will be used.

=== When the master document (english) changes

When the master document (english) file has changed, use the
po4a-updatepo to update the .po files:

```
po4a-updatepo -f text \
  > -m file.adoc \
  > -p file.fr.po
```

=== How to add a new translation language

Determine the ISO 639-1 code for your new language (for example:
English -> "en", Vietnamese -> "vi", etc).  This becomes the "NEWLANG"
variable in the examples below.  There is a list of codes here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>

Add the asciidoc source files containing your new translation. Usually
that means copying the language files from one of the existing
languages, probably English since that's usually the most up-to-date.

Copy the docs/po/Documentation.pot to docs/po/Documentation.$LANG.po.
where $LANG is a two letter language code according to ISO 639-1, or
three letter code according to ISO 639-2 if no two letter code exist.
Add the new language code to the proper place in docs/po4a.conf.

Add the new files in the correct place in `docs/src/Submakefile` to
ensure they will be built.

Edit debian/control.in to add the new linuxcnc-doc-$NEWLANG package.
Add the new doc package to the "or" list of the "Recommends" line of the
linuxcnc main package.

Add the new language to the list in the DOCS_PACKAGES variable in
debian/configure.

If there is a texlive-lang-$NEWLANGUAGE package for your new language,
add it to the DOC_DEPENDS variable in debian/configure.

Add the appropriate `linuxcnc-doc-$NEWLANG.*` files for the new package,
probably by copying and editing `debian/linuxcnc-doc-en.*`.

Test build the packages and verify!

= QT Vismach

Vismach is a set of Python functions that can be used to create and animate
models of machines. +
Vismach displays the model in a 3D viewport and the model
parts are animated +
as the values of associated HAL pins change.

The Vismach viewport view can be manipulated as follows

* zoom  by scroll wheel or right button drag
* pan by left button drag
* rotate by middle-button drag or shift-drag.

A Vismach model takes the form of a Python script and can use standard
Python syntax. +
This means that there is more than one way to lay out the script, but
in the examples given in this document +
I will use the simplest and most basic of them.

The basic sequence in creating the Vismach model is

* Create the parts
* Define how they move
* Assemble into movement groups

== Hierarchy of Machine Design

The model follows logical tree design - picture the tree, with branch
and smaller branches off it if you move the larger branch, smaller
branches will move with it, but if you move smaller branch larger will
not.

Machine design follows that conceptual design, so for example if you
move X, it can move on its own, but if you move Y, it will also move X
assembly, as it is attached to Y assembly. +
So for this machine, tree looks like this:

----
model
  |
  |---frame
  |     |
  |     |---base
  |     |
  |     |---column
  |     |
  |     |---top
  |
  |---yassembly
  |      |
  |      |---xassembly
  |      |      |
  |      |      |---xbase
  |      |      |
  |      |      |---work
  |      |
  |      |---ybase
  |
  |---zassembly
          |
          |---zframe
          |     |
          |     |---zbody
          |     |
          |     |---spindle
          |
          |---toolassembly
                    |
                    |---cat30
                    |
                    |---tool
                         |
                         |---tooltip
                         |
                         |---(tool cylinder function)
----

As you can see, lowest parts must exist first before it can be grouped
with others into assembly.
So you build upwards from lowest point in tree and assembly them
together. +
Same is applicable for any design of machine.
Look at machine arm example and you will see that it starts
with tip and adds to larger part of arm then it finally groups with
base.


== Start the script

It is useful for testing to include the '#!/usr/bin/env python3' to
allow the file to be run as a script. +
The first thing to do is to import the required libraries.

----
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import hal
import math
import sys

from qtvcp.lib.qt_vismach.qt_vismach import *
----

== HAL pins.

Originally the vismach library required creating a component and
connecting HAL pins to control the simulation. +
`qt_vismach` can read the system HAL system pins directly or
if you wish, to use separate HAL pins that you must define in a HAL
component:

[source,python]
----
c = hal.component("samplegui")
c.newpin("joint0", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.newpin("joint1", hal.HAL_FLOAT, hal.HAL_IN)
c.ready()
----

== Creating Parts

It is probably easiest to create geometry in a CAD package and import
into the model script with the AsciiSTL() or AsciiOBJ() functions. +
Both functions can take one of two named arguments, either a filename or
raw data.

* `part = AsciiSTL(filename="path/to/file.stl) +
  part = AsciiSTL(data="solid part1 facet normal ....") +
  part = AsciiOBJ(filename="path/to/file.obj) +
  part = AsciiOBJ(data="v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0 ...")`
+
The parts will be created in the Vismach space in the same locations as
they occupy in the STL or OBJ space. +
This means that it may be possible to assemble the model in the CAD
package.

Alternatively parts can be created inside the model script from a range
of shape primitives. +
Many shapes are created at the origin and need to be moved to
the required location after creation.

* `cylinder = CylinderX(x1, r1, x2, r2) +
  cylinder = CylinderY(y1, r1, y2, r2) +
  cylinder = CylinderZ(z1, r1, z2, r2)` +
  Creates a (optionally tapered) cylinder on the given axis with the
  given radii at the given points on the axis.
* `sphere = Sphere(x, y, z, r)` +
  Creates a sphere of radius r at (x,y,z)
* `triangle = TriangleXY(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, z1, z2) +
  triangle = TriangleXZ(x1, z1, x2, z2, x3, z3, y1, y2) +
  triangle = TriangleYZ(y1, z1, y2, z2, y3, z3, x1, x2)` +
  Creates a triangular plate between planes defined by the last two
  values parallel to the specified plane, with vertices given by the
  three coordinate pairs.
* `arc = ArcX(x1, x2, r1, r2, a1, a2)` +
  Create an arc shape.
* `box = Box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` +
  Creates a rectangular prism with opposite corners at the specified
  positions and edges parallel to the XYZ axes.
* `box = BoxCentered(xw, yw, zw)` +
  Creates an xw by yw by zw box centred on the origin.
* `box = BoxCenteredXY(xw, yw, z)` +
  Creates a box of width xw / yw and height z.

Composite parts may be created by assembling these primitives either at
creation time or subsequently:

----
part1 = Collection([Sphere(100,100,100,50), CylinderX(100,40,150,30)])
part2 = Box(50,40,75,100,75,100)
part3 = Collection([part2, TriangleXY(10,10,20,10,15,20,100,101)])
part4 = Collection([part1, part2])
----

== Orientating Model Parts

Parts may need to be moved in the Vismach space to assemble the model.
They may also need to be moved to create the animation as the animation
rotation axis is created at the origin (but moves with the Part).

* `part1 = Translate([part1], x, y, z)` +
  Move part1 the specified distances in x, y and z.
* `part1 = Rotate([part1], theta, x, y, z)` +
  Rotate the part by angle theta about an axis between the origin and
  x, y, z.

== Animating Parts

To animate the model (controlled by the values of HAL pins) there are
two functions 'HalTranslate', 'HalRotate' and 'HalToolCylinder'. +
For parts to move inside an assembly they need to have their HAL motions
defined before being assembled with the "Collection" command. +
The rotation axis and translation vector move with the part as it is
moved by the vismach script during model assembly, or as it moves in
response to the HAL pins as the model is animated.

* `part = HalTranslate([part], None, "hal_pin_name", xs, ys, zs)` +
  The function arguments are:
** first a _collection/part_ which can be pre-created earlier in the
  script, or could be created at this point if preferred eg
  `part1 = HalTranslate([Box(....)], ...)`. +
** The _HAL component_ is the next argument. +
   In qtvcp if you are reading system pins directly then the component
   argument is set to 'None". +
** After that is the _name of the HAL pin_ that will animate the motion. +
   This needs to match an existing HAL pin that describes the joint
   position such as:
+
----
"joint.2.pos-fb"
----
+
Otherwise the component instance would be specified and the pin name of
that component would be specified.
** Then follow the _X, Y, Z scales_. +
   For a Cartesian machine created at 1:1 scale this would typically
   be 1,0,0 for a motion in the positive X direction. +
   However if the STL file happened to be in cm and the machine was in
   inches, this could be fixed at this point by using 0.3937
   (1cm /2.54in) as the scale.

* `part = HalRotate([part], None, "hal_pin_name", angle_scale, x, y, z)` +
  This command is similar in its operation to HalTranslate except that
  it is typically necessary to move the part to the origin first to
  define the axis. +
** The _axis of rotation_ is from the origin point to the point defined
   by (x,y,z). +
   When the part is moved back away from the origin to its correct
   location the axis of rotation can be considered to remain "embedded"
   in the part.
** _Rotation angles_ are in degrees, so for a rotary joint with a 0-1
   scaling you would need to use an angle scale of 360. +

== Assembling the model.

In order for parts to move together they need to be assembled with the
`Collection()` command. It is important to assemble the parts and define
their motions in the correct sequence.

For example to create a moving head milling machine with a rotating
spindle and an animated draw bar you would:

* Create the head main body.
* Create the spindle at the origin.
* Define the rotation.
* Move the head to the spindle or spindle to the head.
* Create the draw bar
* Define the motion of the draw bar
* Assemble the three parts into a head assembly
* Define the motion of the head assembly.

In this example the spindle rotation is indicated by rotation of a set
of drive dogs:

----
#Drive dogs
dogs = Box(-6,-3,94,6,3,100)
dogs = Color([1,1,1,1],[dogs])
dogs = HalRotate([dogs],c,"spindle",360,0,0,1)
dogs = Translate([dogs],-1,49,0)

#Drawbar
draw = CylinderZ(120,3,125,3)
draw = Color([1,0,.5,1],[draw])
draw = Translate([draw],-1,49,0)
draw = HalTranslate([draw],c,"drawbar",0,0,1)

# head/spindle
head = AsciiSTL(filename="./head.stl")
head = Color([0.3,0.3,0.3,1],[head])
head = Translate([head],0,0,4)
head = Collection([head, tool, dogs, draw])
head = HalTranslate([head],c,"Z",0,0,0.1)

# base
base = AsciiSTL(filename="./base.stl")
base = Color([0.5,0.5,0.5,1],[base]) 
# mount head on it
base = Collection([head, base])
----

Finally a single collection of all the machine parts, floor and work (if
any) needs to be created.

For a _serial machine_ each new part will be added to the collection of
the previous part.

For a _parallel machine_ there may be several "base" parts.

Thus, for example, in `scaragui.py` link3 is added to link2, link2
to link1 and link1 to link0, so the final model is created by:

----
model = Collection([link0, floor, table])
----

Whereas a VMC model with separate parts moving on the base might have

----
model = Collection([base, saddle, head, carousel])
----

== Other functions

* `part = Color([colorspec], [part])` +
  Sets the display color of the part. +
  Note that unlike the other functions the part definition comes second
  in this case. +
  The colorspec consists of the three RGB values and an opacity. +
  For example [1,0,0,0.5] for a 50% opacity red.

* `myhud = Hud() +
  myhud.show("Mill_XYZ")` +
  Creates a heads-up display in the Vismach GUI to display such items as
  axis positions, titles, or messages.

* `part = Capture()` +
  This sets the current position in the model.

* `main(model, tooltip, work, size=10, hud=myhud, rotation_vectors=None,
  lat=0, lon=0)` +
  This is the command that makes it all happen, creates the display etc.
  if invoked directly from python3. +
  Usually this file is imported by qtvcp and the window() object is
  instantiated and embedded into another screen. +
** _model_ should be a collection that contains all the machine parts. +
** _tooltip_ and _work_ need to be created by Capture() to visualize
   their motion in the backplot. +
   See `mill_xyz.py` for an example of how to connect the tool tip to a
   tool and the tool to the model.
** Either _rotation_vectors_ or _latitude/longitude_ can be used to set
   the original viewpoint and it is advisable to do as the default
   initial viewpoint is rather unhelpfully from immediately overhead.
** _size_ sets the extent of the volume visualized in the initial view.
   hud refers to a head-up display of axis positions.

== Basic structure of a QT Vismach script.

# create a top-level model

        mainLayout.addWidget(self.glWidget)
        self.setLayout(mainLayout)

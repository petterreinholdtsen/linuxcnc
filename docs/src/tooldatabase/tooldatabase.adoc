= Tool Database Interface

Tool data is conventionally described by a tool table file specified
by an inifile setting: [EMCIO]TOOL_TABLE=tooltable_filename.  A tool
table file consists of a text line for each available tool describing
the tool's parameters.

See: <<sec:tool-table,Tool Table Format>>

The tool database interface provides an alternative method for
obtaining tool data via a separate program that manages a database of
tools.

==  Interface

=== Ini file Settings

Ini file settings enable the (optional) operation of a user-provided
tool database program:

----
[EMCIO]
DB_PROGRAM = db_program
----

The optional *db_program* specifies the path to a user-provided
executable program that provides tool data.

[NOTE]
Ini file settings for [EMCIO]TOOL_TABLE are ignored when a *db_program*
is specified.

[NOTE]
The *db_program* may be implemented in any language currently
supported in LinuxCNC (e.g., bash scripts, python or tcl scripts,
c/c++ programs) as long as it conforms to the interface messages
received on stdin and replied on stdout.  A *db_program* could
manage data from a flat file, a relational database (sqlite for
example), or other data sources.

=== *db_program* operation (v2.0)

When a *db_progam* is specified, operation is as follows:

. At startup, LinuxCNC starts the *db_program* and connects
  to its stdin and stdout.

. The *db_program* must respond by writing a single line acknowledgement
  consisting of a version string (e.g., "v2.0").  No tools will be
  available if the version is not compatible with the LinuxCNC database
  interface version.

. Upon a successful acknowledgement, LinuxCNC issues a 'g' (*get*)
  command to request all tools.  The *db_program* must respond with a
  sequence of replies to identify each available tool.  The textual
  reply format is identical to the text line format used in conventional tool
  table files.  A final response of "FINI" terminates the reply.

. The *db_program* then enters an event wait loop to receive commands
  that indicate that tool data has been changed by LinuxCNC.  Tool data
  changes include:
  * a) spindle loading(Tn M6)/unloading(T0 M6)
  * b) tool parameter changes (G10L1Pn for example)
  * c) tool substitutions (M61Qn).

When a tool data change occurs, LinuxCNC sends a command to the
*db_program* consisting of an identifying command letter followed by a
full or abbreviated tool data line.  The *db_program* must respond with
a reply to confirm receipt.  If the reply includes the text "'NAK'", a
message is printed to stdout but execution continues.  The "'NAK'"
message signifies a lack of synchronization between the *db_program* and
LinuxCNC -- accompanying text should give an indication for the cause of
the fault.

The commands issued for tool data changes are:

* "'p'" put data changes caused by G10L1, G10L10, G10L11 G-codes.
  The tool data line will include all elements of a tool table
  text line.

* "'l'" spindle_load (TnM6). The tool data line includes only the 'T' and
  'P' items identifying the relevant tool number and pocket number.

* "'u'" spindle_unload (T0M6).  The tool data line includes only the 'T'
  and 'P' items identifying the relevant tool number and pocket number

[NOTE]
When a NON_RANDOM tool changer is specified using
[EMCIO]RANDOM_TOOL_CHANGER=0 (the default), the spindle_load command
issued for TnM6 (or M61Qn) is: 'l Tn P0' (pocket '0' is the spindle).
The spindle_unload command issued for T0M6 is 'u T0 P0'.

[NOTE]
When a RANDOM tool changer is specified using
[EMCIO]RANDOM_TOOL_CHANGER=1, a pair of spindle_unload/spindle_load
commands are issued at each tool exchange.  The pair of commands
issued for TnM6 (or M61Qn) are 'u Tu Pm' followed by 'l Tn P0' where
'u' is the current tool to be sent to pocket 'm' and 'n' is the new
tool to load in the spindle (pocket '0').  By convention, a tool
number of '0' is used to specify an empty tool,

=== Usage

Using a *db_program* does not change the way LinuxCNC operates but
provides support for new database functionality for tool management.

For example, a *db_program* database application can maintain the
operating hours for all tools by tracking each load/unload of a tool.
A machine could then have three 6mm endmills in pockets 111,112, and
113 with the database application programmed to assign tool number 110
to the 6mm endmill with the fewest operating hours.  Then, when a
LinuxCNC program requests tool 110, the database would specify the
appropriate pocket based on tool usage history.

By default, requests for tool data are made at startup only.  A database
program may update tool usage data on a continuous basis so long-lived
LinuxCNC applications may benefit by refreshing the tool data.  The
G-code command *G10 L0* can be used to request a tool data reload ('g'
command) from within G-code programs or by MDI.

A reload operation is also typically provided by a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) so that on-demand reloads can be requested.  For
example, a python GUI application can use:

----
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from  linuxcnc import command
command().load_tool_table()
----

==== Debug Environmental Variables

Exporting the environmental variable DB_SHOW enables LinuxCNC prints (to
stdout) that show tool data retrieved from the *db_program* at startup
and at subsequent reloading of tool data.

Exporting the environmental variable DB_DEBUG enables LinuxCNC prints (to
stdout) for additional debugging information about interface activity.

=== Example program

An example *db_program* (implemented as a python script) is provided
with the simulation examples.  The program demonsrates the
required operations to:

. acknowledge startup version
. receive tool data requests:  'g' (*get* command)
. receive tool data updates:   'p' (*put* command)
. receive tool load updates:   'l' (*load_spindle* command)
. receive tool unload updates: 'u' (*unload_spindle* command)

=== Python tooldb module

The example program uses a LinuxCNC provided python module ('tooldb')
that manages the low-level details for communication and version
verification.  This module uses callback functions specified by the
*db_program* to respond to  the 'g' (get) command and the commands that
indicate tool data changes ('p', 'l', 'u').

The *db_program* uses the 'tooldb' module by implementing the
following python code:

----
user_tools = list(...)   # list of available tool numbers

def user_get_tool(toolno):
    # function to respond to 'g' (get) commands
    # called once for each toolno in user_tools
    ...
def user_put_tool(toolno,params):
    # function to respond to 'p' (put) commands
    ...
def user_load_spindle(toolno,params):
    # function to respond to 'l' (put) commands
    ...
def user_unload_spindle(toolno,params):
    # function to respond to 'u' (put) commands
    ...

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Begin:
from tooldb import tooldb_tools     # identify known tools
from tooldb import tooldb_callbacks # identify functions
from tooldb import tooldb_loop      # main loop

tooldb_tools(user_tools)
tooldb_callbacks(user_get_tool,
                 user_put_tool,
                 user_load_spindle,
                 user_unload_spindle,
                )
tooldb_loop()
----

[NOTE]
Use of 'tooldb' is not required -- it is provided as a demonstration
of the required interface and as a convenience for implementing
python-based applications that interface with an external database.

== Simulation configs

Simulation configs using the axis gui:

. configs/sim/axis/db_demo/*db_ran*.ini    (random_toolchanger)
. configs/sim/axis/db_demo/*db_nonran*.ini (nonrandom_toolchanger)

Each sim config simulates a *db_program* implementing a database
with 10 tools numbered 10--19.

The *db_program* is provided by a single script (db.py) and symbolic
links to it for alternative uses: db_ran.py and db_nonran.py.   (By
default, the script implements random_toolchanger functionality.
Nonrandom toolchanger functions are substituted if the link name
includes the text "'nonran'").

The sim configs demonstrate the use of the python 'tooldb' interface
module and implement a basic flat-file database that tracks tool time
usage for multiple tools having equal diameters.  The database rules
support selection of the tool having the lowest operating time.

=== Notes

When a *db_program* is used in conjunction with a random tool changer
([EMCIO]RANDOM_TOOLCHANGER), LinuxCNC maintains a file
('db_spindle.tbl' in the configuration directory) that consists of a
single tool table line identifying the current tool in the spindle.

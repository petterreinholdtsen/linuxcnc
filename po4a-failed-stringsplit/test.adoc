Testing a large paragraph
with multiple lines.

expected::
   A file whose content is compared to the output from running the test
scripts.
   If the test output is identical to the content of the expected file, the
test succeeds.

If this file exist, a test failure is expected and does not cause
 runtests to return an exit code signaling an error.
